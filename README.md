# TypeScript Reference

# Overview

## Definition

"a strongly typed programming language" ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"uses type inference" ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"adds additional syntax to JavaScript" ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"Describe the shape of objects and functions in your code." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

## Benefits

"giving you better tooling at any scale" ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"Making it possible to see documentation and issues in your editor." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"Many JavaScript apps are made up of hundreds of thousands of files. A single change to one individual file can affect the behaviour of any number of other files, like throwing a pebble into a pond and causing ripples to spread out to the bank. Validating the connections between every part of your project can get time consuming quickly, using a type-checked language like TypeScript can handle that automatically and provide instant feedback during development. These features allows TypeScript to help developers feel more confident in their code, and save considerable amounts time in validating that they have not accidentally broken the project." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/why-create-typescript/))

## Installation

Installing:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

Running the compiler:

```bash
npx tsc
```

## Getting Started

"Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html))

> Adding this to a JS file shows errors in your editor:
>
> ```js
> // @ts-check
> ```
>
> [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

> Using JSDoc to give type information:
>
> ```js
> /** @param {any[]} arr */
> ```

# Language

## Type Inference

"TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html))

> For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes `name: string` and `id: number`, you can write:
>
> ```js
> const user = {
>   name: "Hayes",
>   id: 0,
> };
> ```
>

## Type Definition

### Use Case

"some design patterns make it difficult for types to be inferred automatically (for example, patterns that use dynamic programming). To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an extension of the JavaScript language, which offers places for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html))

### Primitive Types

"There is already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript: `boolean`, `bigint`, `null`, `number`, `string`, `symbol`, and `undefined`, which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as `any` (allow anything), `unknown` (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), `never` (it’s not possible that this type could happen), and `void` (a function which returns `undefined` or has no return value)." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html))

### Interfaces

#### Objects

> You can explicitly describe this object’s shape using an interface declaration:
>
> ```ts
> interface User {
>   name: string;
>   id: number;
> }
> ```
>
> You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new >interface by using syntax like : TypeName after a variable declaration:
>
> ```ts
> const user: User = {
>   name: "Hayes",
>   id: 0,
> };
> ```
>
> [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)

#### Classes

> You can use an interface declaration with classes:
>
> ```ts
> interface User {
>   name: string;
>   id: number;
> }
>
> class UserAccount {
>   name: string;
>   id: number;
>
>   constructor(name: string, id: number) {
>     this.name = name;
>     this.id = id;
>   }
> }
>
> const user: User = new UserAccount("Murphy", 1);
> ```
>
> [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)

#### Functions

> You can use interfaces to annotate parameters and return values to functions:
>
> ```ts
> function deleteUser(user: User) {
>   // ...
> }
>
> function getAdminUser(): User {
>   //...
> }
> ```
>
> [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)

### Interfaces vs. Types

"there are two syntaxes for building types: Interfaces and Types. You should prefer `interface`. Use `type` when you need specific features." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html))

## Type Composition

### Overview

"you can create complex types by combining simple ones. There are two popular ways to do so: with unions, and with generics." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html))
