# TypeScript Reference

# Overview

## Definition

"a strongly typed programming language" ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"uses type inference" ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"adds additional syntax to JavaScript" ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"Describe the shape of objects and functions in your code." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

## Benefits

"giving you better tooling at any scale" ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"Making it possible to see documentation and issues in your editor." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org))

"Many JavaScript apps are made up of hundreds of thousands of files. A single change to one individual file can affect the behaviour of any number of other files, like throwing a pebble into a pond and causing ripples to spread out to the bank. Validating the connections between every part of your project can get time consuming quickly, using a type-checked language like TypeScript can handle that automatically and provide instant feedback during development. These features allows TypeScript to help developers feel more confident in their code, and save considerable amounts time in validating that they have not accidentally broken the project." ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/why-create-typescript/))
